## Credits

### Content

The content of the site is closely analagous to real world walks that I, as well as friends or family, have either been on myself, or have been near to.
The names referred to as Hudds Hikes' founders, my own excluded, are the names of people that have a unique relationship with hiking, either by their connection to me or their relationship to someone I have been hiking with previously.

### Media
