# Hudds Hikes

## Code Institute - Milestone Project 1

*Hudds Hikers* is a fictional group dedicated to providing a disability-friendly hiking (or rambling, as it is sometimes referred to) experience. The 'Hudds' is shorthand for Huddersfield, a large town based in the UK, West Yorkshire. The idea for this project was inspired by a hiking trip to Snowdonia, Wales, with friends in July 2022, and through my work in a care home for individuals undergoing physical rehabilitation. I noticed a lack of dedicated hiking groups online for those less physically able. Though individual groups that form the backbone of wesbites such as ramblers.org.uk make reference to inclusivity, this information was hard to find via regular site navigation. The idea of building a local rambling website that puts inclusivity at the forefront of its philosophy, highlighting walks and potential trips that are friendly to wheelchair and mobility-device users, amongst others, held appeal to me, as countryside accessibility needs to be improved upon; some routes simply need extra path maintenance or a small side-route around a stile to remove rambling barriers for many!

This is the first of five projects that comprise the Full Stack Software Development course ran by *Code Institute*. This project required the use of HTML and CSS3 to build a responsive and static website with three pages or more.

## Defining the UX

### Primary Goals

 - To make information about an inclusive walking group and accessible walks in the Huddersfield district, and further afield, more readily available, appealing to those who are put off by inaccessibility issues in countryside hiking and encouraging participation.

 - To ensure it is easy for users to sign up for a free membership to the group and include themselves in a mailing list that details upcoming walks and trips that are of interest.

 - To define Hudds Hikes as credible in their dedication to providing inclusive hiking experiences while acknowledging more work needs to be done in this area.

 - To make a website that is responsive and static across computers, tablets and phones.

### User Stories

- I am a wheelchair user who has an interest in hiking but is put off by accessibility issues such as stiles, locked gates en route, poor path maintenance and not knowing, if any, what parts of the countryside have solutions in place for said issues.

- I am a person with a physical disability that is not bound by a wheelchair or other device, and I am looking for walks in the Huddersfield area.

- I am somebody looking for the existence of a disability-friendly hiking group as information on inclusivity in hiking is not at the forefront of rambling group pages.

- I am a user of a tablet and a phone. I want to experience all the website's features in an aesthetically pleasing manner.

- I am the one of the founders of Hudds Hikers. I want a website that encourages people to simply turn up to a walk and be part of a group that is promoring and developing wider access to the countryside.

### Design Process

1. I began designing the site by outlining what features and information I wanted my website to have, bearing in mind the user stories above. This led me to decide on creating three seperate pages: "Home" "Events" and "Join Us".

2. I wanted to immediately quell the notion that hiking is only for the able-bodied by displaying inspiring images on the site's homepage. The images include somebody being carried in a special mobility device, a wheelchair user sat with her friend atop a high peak, and a person in a mobility vehicle being lowered/lifted while looking at a mountainous backdrop, amongst others. This would also serve to set the tone for what Hudds Hikers philosophise as a rambling group, and to provide immediate engagement.

3. After reading some basic information about the group and the nature of the walks on offer, a positive first impression garnered of Hudds Hikes would be reinforced by listing why the group thinks it's worth joining. This led to the "Why Ramble With Us?" section on the homepage.

4. It was at this point that I commenced a wireframe design on [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPVVcxhY=/?share_link_id=156333714561). The basic layout of the site holds true to the wireframe layout, though it is not to scale. The greatest deviation from the wireframe came from the layout of the images on the homepage. Having information about walks horizontally aligned is visually impractical on smaller screen sizes, and the headline images at the top of the page 

5. For the group 'to put it's money where it's mouth is', concrete information about upcoming walks, including wheelchair and mobility-vehicle friendly walks, is included immediately afterwards in the 'Our Upcoming Walks' section, as well as on the 'Events' page, as means of the group's intention to carry their intentions further afield.

[The entirety of the wireframe can be seen at this link](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPVVcxhY=/?share_link_id=156333714561)

Please note that the wireframe was not created to scale, and doesn't include any code stylings or images.

## Features

### Basic Features

This project consists of three pages, each accessible by the relevant links on the top-right of each page.

### Consistent Features

- A menu header displaying the "Hudds Hikers" logo at the top-left (also acting as a homepage link when clicked) and three navigation links at the top-right.
- Four social media links at the bottom of each page as a footer.

### Home

- A gallery of eight images near the page top, intended to promote the belief that physical disability is not a barrier to participating in hiking activities.
- An introduction to the Hudds Hikers group, promoting the group's key philosophy and the structure of the walks on offer.
- Four major reasons to hike with the group made easily visible and supported by adjacent FontAwesome icons.
- Details of six upcoming walks, each with an embedded map, two of which are marked as wheelchair and mobility device friendly, intended to communicate to a site visitor that Hudds Hikes are inclusive where physically possible. A note of participation encouragement is included, along with a link to sign up for a free membership.

### Events

- Details of two extended walking trips are included on this page to communicate the scope of the activities of the group. Large images are included as part of the trip outline. Hiking groups that have been or are local to me have ran trips of a similiar nature before, and I sought to repliacte that with this page.

### Join Us

- Contains a form that users must fill in to become a group member. All fields must be filled in and the final checkbox must be left selected or unselected. At larger screen sizes, a silhouette of an individual in a wheelchair can be seen.

### Features Not Implemented/For Future Consideration

- I considered the use of drop-down menus to present information about upcoming walks, much in the same way as the [Huddersfield Ramblers](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/group-finder/areas/west-riding/groups/huddersfield/our-events--activities.aspx) group does. JavaScript was used in the creation of these menus, and was beyond the scope of limitations for this project.

- A feature that goes beyond the scope of this project would be a members-only website section, where the group's founders could be contacted more directly. This could contain a forum as well, allowing group members to discuss upcoming walks and ask each other questions.

- A news page that informs readers of developments in countryside accessibility, whether it be the group purchasing mobile carrier devices (an alternative to wheelchairs) or local pathways becoming more accessible, e.g. through maintenance funds.

### Broswer Testing

The website was tested on the following broswers to ensure design, responsiveness and buttons, links etc worked as intended:

- Mozilla Firefox
- Google Chrome

### Testing Responsiveness

I manually tested the project via the following methods:

- Using Firefox Developer Tools and Chrome Developer Tools to view ecah of the project pages at different screen sizes;
- Asking a friend to help me test and brainstorm CSS styling methods during a troubleshooting evening; 
- Asking for mentor support during call sessions when I indicated I was struggling with some concepts.

## Deployment

## Deploying the site on GitHub

1. I clicked on the 'Settings' icon of my project repository on GitHub.
2. To the left of the next screen, clicking on 'Pages' took me to GitHub Pages.
3. I selected "Deploy from a branch" under the "Source" drop-down menu.
4. Using two drop-down menus, I ensured my site was to be built from the 'main' branch and the '/ (root)' folder.
5. My site was deployed to GitHub Pages after a few minutes, allowing me to share the live site to others.

## Credits

### Content

The content of the site is closely analagous to real world walks that I, as well as friends or family, have either been on myself, or have been near to.

The names referred to as Hudds Hikes' founders, my own excluded, are the names of people that have a unique relationship with hiking, either by their connection to me or their relationship to someone I have hiked with previously.
