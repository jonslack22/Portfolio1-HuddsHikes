## Credits

### Content

The content of the site is closely analagous to real world walks that I, as well as friends or family, have either been on myself, or have been near to.
The names referred to as Hudds Hikes' founders, my own excluded, are the names of people that have a unique relationship with hiking, either by their connection to me or their relationship to someone I have hiked with previously.

### Media

All the images at the top of the site's homepage were sourced from (stock.adobe.com) under the search term "disability hike" from the first 5 of 15 results pages. Search last retrieved on 9/27/2022.

The image used for the "Snowdonia Ramble Trip" on (https://8000-jonslack22-portfolio1hu-o2rxg0broqq.ws-eu67.gitpod.io/events.html) is my own personal image taken via phone while walking down the Pyg Track route.
The image for the "Lake District Ramble Trip" on the same page was given to me by my friend, Joshua Moss, who accompanied me on a walk up Scafell Pike in 2021. Permission was obtained to use the image for the deployed Hudds Hike project.
