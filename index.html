        <h2>Welcome to the homepage of Hudds Hikers!</h2><div id="#">
            <div class="#">
                <p>We are a new, independent rambling group operating from the heart of Kirklees, Huddersfield. Founded in 2020 by Jonathan Slack, Kevin Smith and Steven Moss, our aim is to provide accessible rambling experiences to as wide an audience as possible, including those with minor physical and mental disabilities. Our schedule includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>5-6 mile walks on Tuesday and Thursday evenings during summer</li>
                    <li>"B" grade walks of 6-9 miles on Sundays</li>
                    <li>In summer, monthly slower-paced "A-minus" walks for those who would like a longer walk of up to 11 miles, typically on Saturdays</li>
                    <li>Easy monthly Saturday walks of up to 5 miles on Saturdays and Sundays (C-grade walks) for those looking to build up fitness or become more active, and new members of the group.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please note: as a group aiming to cater towards disabilities, we don't currently offer walks of grade "A" or higher. This may be subject to change as the fitness levels and capabilities of the group members change, however.</p>
                <p>By default, all our walks are circular.</p>
                <p>Our wheelchair and mobility scooter friendly walks are denoted by a wheelchair <i"#"></i> icon.</p>

                    Become part of an inclusive group that works in partnership with organisations such as the <a href="#">Disabled Ramblers</a> and the <a href="#">FieldFare Trust</a> in helping remove the barriers that stop those who have limited mobility in enjoying rambling. At Hudds Hikes, we believe that the countryside should be as accessible as possible.

                    With an extensive knowledge of the landscapes and history comprising our walks in the Kirklees, Pennines and Yorkshire districts, you won't receive a better countryside tour from anyone else!

                    We offer an extensive social scene throughout the calendar year, including meals out, holidays and walks further afield. We're quite partial to a pint and a pub-cooked meal after our walks, as well!
