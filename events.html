        <h2>Upcoming Events</h2>

        <h2>Snowdonia Ramble Trip</h2>
        <h3>18th - 21st November 2022</h3>
        <p>Hudds Hikers return to the lovely national park of Snowdonia for four days!</p> 
        <p>We have various walks of differing intensity planned for the duration of the trip, including limited-mobility friendly wlaks such as Mawdacch Trail, Lon Gwyrfai and Llyn Tegid North.</p>
        <p>Trampers, off-road scooters crafted by Snowdonia National Park Authority, are available for hire and come highly recommended. Click <a href="#">here</a> for more information.</p>
        <p>Naturally, we plan for a challenging walk up yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) itself, this time along the Pyg Track!</p>
        <p>Starting from Pen y Pass, the Pyg track is one of the shortest but most difficult routes to the summit of Snowdon. Rest assured that the exertion is worth it, as the summit provides ample opportunity for photography. Weather permitting, of course.</p>
        <p>Hudds Hikes will retain its tradition of booking accommodation at Pen y Pass' nearby youth hostel for the duration of the trip, subject to availability, though group members are free to make their own arrangements. Stays at nearby Llanberis, the Pen y Gwryd Hotel and Llyn Gwynant Campsite top our recommendation list for easy transport access.</p>

        <h2>Lake District Ramble Trip</h2>
        <h3>24th - 28th March 2023</h3>
        <p>Hudds Hikers' yearly tradition of Lake District rambling continues!</p>
        <p>Come the start of 2023, limited-mobility friendly walks of varying diffciluty from the <a href="#">"Miles without Stiles"</a>collection of routes will be chosen as this years' accessible rambles of interest.</p>
        <p>Trampers are available for hire from <a href="#">Lake District Mobility</a></p>
        <p>As the Helvellyn walk proved so popular last year, Hudds Hikes offer the chance for a ramble up Scafell Pike!</p>
        <p>At 978 meters (or 3210ft), Scafell Pike is the hardest of the Lake District's "Three Peaks" challenge, with a steep incline guarding the summit. Successful climbers are rewarded with one of the most gorgeous views of the entire Lake District.</p>
        <p>Acoomodation booking will take place via youth hostels in either Ambleside or Keswick, subject to availability. More will be announced in early 2023.</p>
